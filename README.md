Eurorack 0603 triple S&amp;H in 4hp (based on the S&H section of Mutable Instruments Kinks module)

Please note - I havent used this BOM in the spreadsheet to build a module (I had all the parts as spares!) - it's provided to help - but please check it first!

NOTE - it's fine to use ceramic caps instead of the tantalums!

Please note - pcbs and panels are being sold by other people - I have no connection, financial or otherwise, to anyone selling pcbs and panels, hence I feel no commercial obligation to offer build support! I am just freely offering up these designs! Enjoy!
