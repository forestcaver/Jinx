Eurorack 0603 triple S&amp;H in 4hp (based on the S&H section of Mutable Instruments Kinks module)

I have deleted the BoM which contained Mouser part numbers etc. as, despite requests here, I was receiveing far too many requests for part substitutions and advice on the BoM and build. Apologies to those who found it useful, but you can generate one from Eagle.

**** Please note - pcbs and panels are being sold by other people - I have no connection, financial or otherwise, to anyone selling pcbs and panels, hence I feel no commercial obligation to offer build support! I am just freely offering up these designs! Enjoy! ****
